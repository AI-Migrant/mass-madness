## Privacy violation

Shortly after entering the Foreigners Registration Centre in Lithuania, I overheard the mention of “6 A’s” and “number 1” for some unknown reason. I did show the Migration Department of Lithuania the results of my latest studies, hoping to let them know I was working hard and would be able to contribute, but I didn’t mention it to anyone else. Moreover, the result didn’t specify a rank, nor did I.

And why was it even their business? I don’t think there were good reasons. A reason I can think of is similar to the reason why they have been damaging my health. A crazy and pathetic one.

When I was studying in my homeland, there were some other “students”, whether or not they were students, I feel sure that they were with the persecutors now, from whom I overheard, “No way we lose to him in every aspect”. It’s funny that it didn’t appear natural to them, considering that they spent their time helping the persecutors, whereas I spent my time improving myself.

I should clarify that the result mentioned was actually not as impressive as it might sound. The institute I studied at was the Vocational Training Council (VTC) in Hong Kong. The exam or test was not as serious as the HKALE (A-Level, for matriculation) or even the HKDSE (for secondary five).

## Condescension

A staff member contacted me when I decided to quit the programme; I mentioned the situation of the study group during the conversation. Her response was something like “Oh, it’s because they don’t play with you.” I probably failed to respond because I was rendered speechless. 

Does this sound familiar if you have read my entries? It’s the “Baby, hehehe.” mentality and narrative. Persecutors seem to like infantilising their targets and proceed to feel everything they do is automatically justified, perhaps because “they are adults and know better”?

If you have heard about the 2019 protests in Hong Kong, the perpetrators in the 2019 Yuen Long attack also had the same narrative. They called their attack “to teach children”. It, in turn, has more similarities with my persecution, such as organised assaults with the police on the side of the perpetrators, or rather, the assailants (and thieves in my case) are on the side of the authorities; a police station closed in unlikely hours or I got intimidated when I visited for help with information or contacting the Home Office; torch was shone at my eyes when the officers counted heads in midnights.

She also asked if I read Naruto. She seemed disappointed when I said I didn’t. I said she could still talk about it. If I remember correctly, she said that there was a character who put everyone into a dream according to his idea of an ideal world; she said that it’s like Greta Thunberg and that if one wants everyone listen to them, one has to be an emperor. I am not sure where that came from, but the mention of Thunberg was probably because environmental protection was in one of my projects, and possibly because of surveillance. Again, this resonates with the persecutor group’s narrative during the supposed asylum process. Some of the names they called me include: king, boss and big boss. And for what reason? Because I don’t respond favourably to their harassment, insult, literal harm, etc.? Many of their name-calling, including “refugee”, suggests they think that I should have taken their animosity as normal, when they have a problem with even me ignoring their harassment.

There was a time when someone approached me and suggested that we should be closer as our nations were close to each other. He mentioned his admiration for the patriotism and nationalism of the Chinese people. It was a time when it was already clear that every person who talked to me there was with the persecutors, but I talked to him nonetheless. By Chinese people, he most likely meant the Communist Chinese. I told him that they only take, won’t give. I told him an example of when I was studying in my homeland. I took the initiative to start a study group. I eventually stopped talking in the group because they wouldn’t say anything, even when they knew the answers to the questions raised. He changed the topic, if I remember correctly; by the end of the conversation, his friendliness had already gone.

## Everything is a tool to them

They also sent children to me for unknown reasons. You may recall that they falsely accused me of photographing children after an arbitrary arrest in the UK. It continued even after that. They would have children waiting at places I often stop by. For example, they would wait at a park with the children and have them come to “use the facility I was using to exercise”, precisely in the middle of my workout. On one recent occasion, they even had the children bump into me when I was sitting. This is one of the reasons that I said everything is a tool to them.

Another notable instance happened soon after my application in Lithuania. One child told another to come to play with me, but added, “But remember, he is no good.” I think it’s reasonable to assume that a child won’t tell another to play with a stranger while saying something like that on their own. Till this day, I cannot fathom the sickness behind it.

## Stalking/Campaign of disruption and intimidation

Places I visit will suddenly become “popular” and crowded, and services will pause or go offline. I have mentioned that I am constantly stalked—this even includes toilets. It won’t be too far from the truth to say that if I go into a loo, then it must follow, as the night the day, the urinals won’t be left to decay.

But they surely go above and beyond when it comes to these kinds of things. Here is an email exchange between me and a charity, at whose premises the persecutors attempted to break into the toilet following a suspected case of food poisoning.

I believe it’s not hard to tell I am not proud to mention the things I mentioned in the letter, but the sickness must be brought to the light.

Again, I am appalled by the fact that behaviours as sick as this could be supported by a huge number of people.
