## Degradation
They have long wanted to make me look like a beggar since, again, the days in Lithuania.

I have been saying that they are helping the persecutors and are covering up the crimes committed. However, given all that has happened, I wouldn't be surprised if they also commit crimes for their own sake.

### Discrimination
They wanted to pretend it's common racism. They also tried to pretend it is how normal interpersonal interactions between people from different origin are. Yeah, I am sure it include drugging, molestation, health damage, assault, theft, etc.
It seems more horrible when it's not even based on ethnicity, gender or other categorisation.
