## Molestation
I have been wondering: are the people who are raging on social media about the gang rapes real people? I have carried signs on me about being drugged and molested for a year now. Not only have I not seen rage in the people on the street, but the people at the places I stop by also don’t seem to see a problem in it. Even if we consider the unlikely case where none of the passersby looked at the signs, the people definitely have seen them. Instead of rage, I have only seen laughter. Again, even if they are not laughing at the molestation, how could the matter be any fun, given the existence of the sexual offence? And that’s just one offence among many.
