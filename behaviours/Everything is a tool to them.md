## Everything is a tool to them

### Childen
They also sent children to me for unknown reasons. You may recall that they falsely accused me of photographing children after an arbitrary arrest in the UK. It continued even after that. They would have children waiting at places I often stop by. For example, they would wait at a park with the children and have them come to “use the facility I was using to exercise”, precisely in the middle of my workout. On one recent occasion, they even had the children bump into me when I was sitting. This is one of the reasons that I said everything is a tool to them.

Another notable instance happened soon after my application in Lithuania. One child told another to come to play with me, but added, “But remember, he is no good.” I think it’s reasonable to assume that a child won’t tell another to play with a stranger while saying something like that on their own. Till this day, I cannot fathom the sickness behind it.
