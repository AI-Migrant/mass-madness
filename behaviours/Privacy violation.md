Shortly after entering the Foreigners Registration Centre in Lithuania, I overheard the mention of “6 A’s” and “number 1” for some unknown reason. I did show the Migration Department of Lithuania the results of my latest studies, hoping to let them know I was working hard and would be able to contribute, but I didn’t mention it to anyone else. Moreover, the result didn’t specify a rank, nor did I.

And why was it even their business? I don’t think there were good reasons. A reason I can think of is similar to the reason why they have been damaging my health. A crazy and pathetic one.

When I was studying in my homeland, there were some other “students”, whether or not they were students, I feel sure that they were with the persecutors now, from whom I overheard, “No way we lose to him in every aspect”. It’s funny that it didn’t appear natural to them, considering that they spent their time helping the persecutors, whereas I spent my time improving myself.

I should clarify that the result mentioned was actually not as impressive as it might sound. The institute I studied at was the Vocational Training Council (VTC) in Hong Kong. The exam or test was not as serious as the HKALE (A-Level, for matriculation) or even the HKDSE (for secondary five).
