## Intimidation
I mentioned in the entries that I was intimidated on the occasions when I asked for help at police stations.

If you think about it, many of the other crimes are also part of the intimidation.

The most interesting part is that calling the police has been something the harassers, stalkers, people who deny my access to my data, etc., would say.

And why was it necessary to intimidate me even when I was simply trying to submit my identification, get information or contact the Home Office?
