## Stalking

Places I visit will suddenly become “popular” and crowded, and services will pause or go offline. I have mentioned that I am constantly stalked—this even includes toilets. It won’t be too far from the truth to say that if I go into a loo, then it must follow, as the night the day, the urinals won’t be left to decay.

But they surely go above and beyond when it comes to these kinds of things. Here is an email exchange between me and a charity, at whose premises the persecutors attempted to break into the toilet following a suspected case of food poisoning.

I believe it’s not hard to tell I am not proud to mention the things I mentioned in the letter, but the sickness must be brought to the light.

Again, I am appalled by the fact that behaviours as sick as this could be supported by a huge number of people.
