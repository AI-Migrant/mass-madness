Please excuse me for writing this in a simple and straightforward manner. This is serious. I am typing this despite being under extreme surveillance. I'm not even sure if this email can reach you securely, nor if I can receive your reply.  

If you want to confirm, I currently spend most of my time at the Pancras Square Library during the day and sleep on the street around the area. I am usually in a red jacket and carrying bags with signs. However, please don’t consider that I am fine just because I can still use the library to a certain degree. After they have stolen my belongings, what I can do is further limited.

I have suffered 3.75 years of persecution facilitated by the host countries, namely, Lithuania and the UK.  
Please read https://github.com/AI-Migrant/mass-madness/blob/main/Help%20me%20find%20out%20what%20crimes%20they%20have%20been%20committing.md

I know it might not be a matter that directly concerns you, but I can only try to ask for help to expose this madness. Help me find out what other crimes my persecutors have been committing and bring the matter to light, please.

Please don't tell me to seek help from the local authorities, such as the police. They are part of the persecutor group. The persecutor group feels powerful and thinks that it is very funny.


Thank you.
