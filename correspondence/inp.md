Please don’t try to talk to me. I can only read, and I am inclined to believe that those who come to talk to me are most likely from the persecutor group that takes advantage of this and tries to lead people into believing their narrative.

I am constantly monitored and stalked. If someone(s) appears to try to speak to me, over 95% they are from the persecutor group. If they try to fill you in about me, over 99% they are the persecutors. If they are from the authorities, there is virtually no chance that they are not the persecutors.

I have been treated as non-human for almost 4 years now. Months ago, the local authorities and foreign persecutors stole my belongings. All kinds of organisations side with them without question. There are even a huge number of members of the public supporting them.

If you can’t believe and acknowledge the above, you may want to just leave.

Before reading what I want to say here, you should read https://github.com/AI-Migrant/mass-madness/blob/main/correspondence/inn.md first.

If you decide to do something after reading this and the other files, please know that they have vast number and influence, and I won’t even be able to keep any secret due to the surveillance and control. I don’t even know if your email will reach me if you write one.

<strong>If you decide to help look into the matter, please make sure you have taken all safety measures possible. Make sure you have someone you can trust your life with to check on you regularly.</strong>

What I ultimately need is written in the README.md on https://github.com/AI-Migrant/mass-madness.

But that definitely won’t be easy. What I would like to ask from you is.
1. Try to contact people who will be able to look into the matter. If you are from other EU countries, maybe you can try to ask your Migrant Department to look up the records. Although the chance that they won’t side with the persecutors, if they are not already one group, is very slim.  
And please remember to take all the safety measures I mentioned above.
2. Make a tiny investment in me, with which I will buy a budget laptop to replace the one stolen by the persecutors. I tried to ask organisations which are supposed to be part of the National Device Bank, but they either say they only do other things in the programme or that there is no such thing. In whichever case, every organisation or even shop will be contacted by the persecutor group, which includes authorities, and it won’t be easy for me.

Please beware that I emphasise **tiny**, like 5 to 10 pounds, because of the risk I am going to mention below. But again, you should know some other things first.

As mentioned above, I won’t be able to keep any information private. You can give me some kind of account to repay you if you are not worried about the persecution madness. Or you can name a cause you would like me to contribute to with the repayment, which should be relatively safe if you send me the message carefully.

But please read about the risks and the time it might take first. They could sound absurd.

- They are constantly monitoring me, have multiple methods to put me under various effects, have thieves ready to steal for them and can arrest me arbitrarily or abuse power in other ways when they deem necessary. I cannot make sure my belongings won’t get stolen again.
- No matter where I buy the device, it will almost be guaranteed that no privacy will be safe on the device. It will become part to the surveillance the persecutors have on me.
- I don’t know when the persecution will end. If it doesn’t, I won’t be able to do anything; you get nothing.
- I don’t know if the persecution will continue in another way afterwards. If it does, you get nothing.
- I don’t know if I will die early for some reason. If I do, you get nothing.
- I don’t know if I can more or less live as a normal human again, even if all these end. If I cannot, you get nothing.
- I hope I can get back on my feet, but if I can’t, you get nothing.
- I don’t know how long it will take, even if all the above happen.  
The only thing I can guarantee is that I will repay you many times over if all the above happen. The only thing I can give you now is my word.
