I have been treated as non-human for almost 4 years now. Months ago, the local authorities and foreign persecutors stole my belongings. All kinds of organisations side with them without question. I am under constant surveillance. If someone(s) appears to try to speak to me, over 95% they are from the persecutor group. If they try to fill you in about me, over 99% they are the persecutors. If they are from the authorities, there is virtually no chance that they are not the persecutors.

If you can’t believe and acknowledge the above, you may want to just leave.

- I don’t know how long it will take, even if all the above happen.
The only thing I can guarantee is that I will...
