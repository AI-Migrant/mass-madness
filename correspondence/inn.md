I am surely not flawless, but I hope that you won’t look the other way because of the aspersions cast upon me.


I wanted to write enough to let you know more about the situation, but I am afraid that by the time I have written most of the things, there won’t be much left of me. I hope what I have written is enough to let you know I tried to offer the best, even considered death to be acceptable, but got treated as non-human for years. This is a basis I hope you acknowledge; I am not looking forward to suffering new persecutors.

The repository mass-madness is more like a summary of the persecution.

The repository asylum_diary was kind of a record of the things that happened. It became more direct about the persecution when I no longer doubted that the host countries had joined the persecutors.
