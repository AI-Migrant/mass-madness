An attempt to make summaries over ranges of matters: https://github.com/AI-Migrant/mass-madness

The entries I wrote over the years of persecution: https://github.com/AI-Migrant/asylum_diary

The first thing I hope you understand is that this is serious. I am writing this under the surveillance of the persecutors, which include the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and the governments of Lithuania and the United Kingdom (UK). It doesn’t matter if I write on my device, or on a device in a library or a charity.

Secondly, when I don’t claim to be a flawless man, I assure you that I was completely cooperative, had the interest of the host countries in mind, and appreciated even the smallest things when I applied for asylum. On the other hand, I dare say they let the persecutors handle things related to me and facilitated humiliation and harm.

I have been suffering the current torment since April 2022. I am not asking for direct help, but I hope that you can find out why they need to treat me like I am a murderer, monitor me 24/7, have an absurd number of people stalking me, formally arrest me based on false accusations multiple times, and, at the same time, humiliate and harm me non-stop. They also like drugging and molesting me with unknown devices. They used to arrange women and even young girls to walk in front of me, too. I hope you can find out what happened since I applied for asylum in Lithuania or attempted to volunteer for Ukraine in Poland. I am not able to do that myself. Maybe one day, what you find out will be meaningful.

They also formally arrested me multiple times with accusations they absolutely knew were fake. They took my fingerprints twice. The second time happened 1 year after the first, when they gave me a 1-year warning for “photographing children” when in fact, it was the persecutors, who include the locals, that stalked and aimed their cameras at me. The second time, they say that I am here illegally.

I believe at least part of the reason they are doing all these is for misdirection. To redirect the focus from what crimes they have committed to whatever they are accusing me of. Something which the CCP often do. And I am afraid it’s not just the CCP, given the past years.

I am supposed to be an asylum seeker here in the UK. But I believe just like Lithuania created an environment for the CCP to try whatever they wanted to harm and control me, and invalidate my claim, and later also to cover the crimes they had committed in the process, the UK is also helping them both to do the same.

I have explicitly told Lithuania and the UK that I felt tortured and asked them to stop their violations. It’s useless, till this day I am still suffering an array of sick behaviours, including but not limited to stalking, network control, drugging, molestation, and denied information, the right to meet a solicitor when arbitrarily arrested, and access to things, including public transport, without interference. For smaller matters, even what I eat is interfered with. I said I feel treated as non-human and I meant it.

---

Currently, they have stolen almost everything from me. I stay alive on the street basically under their arrangement while being monitored and restricted both physically and digitally in a way that’s not obvious to people on the street.

A life that doesn’t even remotely resemble a normal one, let alone doing anything meaningful.

My situation is generally unsafe. They would and had pushed it to life-threatening danger to invalidate it, despite I had said that’s not the kind of safety I was talking about.

Physical safety. I had been assaulted, and I absolutely cannot get help from the authorities. In fact, the authorities arrested me after one of the assaults to protect the perpetrators.

Digital safety. I have been under extreme surveillance that monitors me both physically and digitally, including my sleeping area and bathroom. My network is controlled. Both my physical and digital mail can be intercepted.

Property safety. I have long been aware that I can’t really do anything or own anything safely, neither physically nor digitally. The latest theft, which stole almost everything from me, is proof. The incident about the bicycle I bought for commuting was another. It also showed that they don’t care about what problems will be caused when it’s me who will suffer.

Here is some of what has happened from what I can see:

It probably started with the CCP’s belief in manipulation over human beings. They likely believed the asylum process was the perfect opportunity. They are still exploiting it after today, in January 2025—44 months since they were allowed to unleash their sickness in the Foreigner Registration Centre in Lithuania. 

Given what happened, I can only arrive at this conclusion: Lithuania agreed and helped. They probably committed some extra crimes during my stay in Lithuania.

The UK most likely sees the same and helps them, with the added necessity of covering the crimes they committed in Lithuania, and later in the UK. They knew what crimes were committed against me, and they decided to double down. As if going even further in the UK would justify what happened in Lithuania.

As the situation dragged on, they committed more and more crimes. It became a self-reinforcing behaviour that cannot end.

I believe the CCP, Lithuania, and the UK have together committed more crimes than just what they have been doing to me directly. More than what I have written in my online entries.

They probably have other narratives for the situation. One of the things they seem to be doing is to ridicule the whole situation, and a lot of people are buying. Otherwise, I won’t know how to justify their remaining silence or worse, participating in ridiculing and normalising the harassment, which in turn seems to be enough to justify the worse parts of the persecution for them.

To be honest, I think that you would trust the authorities of Lithuania and the UK over me. I can only hope that you can check my entries at https://github.com/AI-Migrant/asylum_diary/. It should refute most of the accusations they might use to justify the crimes they have committed against me, although some may not be very obvious, and some were not even recorded.

If you can get the records of our conversations, which they claimed there was none or refused to give me, you should be about to find that they often dodge some topics. I mentioned that they likely let the persecutors handle me directly. I tried to contact the Home Office multiple times, and also asked to establish a safe channel to communicate with the Home Office. They refused.

They clearly know they are committing crimes against me. Take their stalking and camera aiming, for example. They clearly feel that it's a problem when I started recording in return. Some of the other crimes were more or less stemmed from it. So why don't they have a problem when they have been doing it to me for years?

Also, since months after my application for asylum in Lithuania, they have been saying things like, “want revenge?”, “refugee?”, and “Mustafa/Mostafa” in a mocking tone. The way they said “refugee” was as if I should have accepted what they had done to me if I was really a refugee. That’s mindblowing given what they had been doing. Some examples are:

Throughout the years of the asylum process, I have received barely any documents or information from them, and even less was genuine. You will be able to find in the latter entries that they literally deny me basic rights, with which information was also denied. With information withheld, I have been treated arbitrarily, to say the least.

They have repeatedly damaged my health. My respiratory system is severely weakened and hasn’t been able to recover.

They have been drugging and molesting me. Degrees vary; the length spans years.

I believe what they have been doing to me is serious enough to be called crimes against humanity.

I feel quite sure, after suffering the past years of persecution facilitated by Lithuania and the UK, that the email address I was given at the Embassy of Ukraine in Warsaw was fake. It was a Gmail, likely created by my original persecutors. Does it mean Poland or Ukraine was also working with the CCP?

I stopped cutting my hair when I sensed something was wrong in the early summer of 2022, and started writing on GitHub things that seemed out of place.

I also started using an ID, Lochard Partrick, which sounds like a very offensive term in my language—Cantonese—for a very idiotic person around that time. I hoped that the Lithuanians could see that I was deeply troubled and stop what was happening, whether because it was a joke that should stop or because a realisation of how wrong it’s to help the CCP. It didn’t happen.

6 months became 10, 10 months became 1 year, and at the end, when I left Lithuania, it was 22 months. No information, but non-stop harassment. The harassment, humiliations, and health damages just couldn’t be justified.

From LLM, one of the things they have been doing to me is called “Double Bind”.

You can read them if you are interested.
