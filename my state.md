# I am not fine
The persecutors act as if what they have done to me was not serious. That's just a way to dismiss their crime.

One of the reasons they have been repeating their petty crimes is also likely to direct the focus away from the serious crimes they have committed.

I hope that before you get some crazy ideas from the persecutor group, whose size is on a transnational level, you can keep in mind that the following happened since the beginning and continues to this day. I tried to interpret their actions differently, but eventually concluded that the most probable explanation is that they are accomplices of the CCP. Please also keep in mind that a huge number of members of the public are helping them, which means they support the sick behaviours. Probably more know about the situation but remain silent.

Please compound every act of persecution by 3.5 years and the support from the members of the public.

They have assisted the CCP in forcing me to relive persecution, further treating me discriminately, humiliating me and causing permanent damage to my health—despite my attempts to volunteer for Ukraine, a country they claim to support.

They have been drugging and molesting me for years. I didn’t realise at the beginning.

They are now blatantly committing crimes, including but not limited to stalking, assault, theft, and are backing them with power abuse, arbitrary arrests and denial of rights.

They are also further limiting my access to public services, after stealing my belongings to take away the means for me to spend my time in a less wretched way.

Aside from the violations I have been suffering almost every day, the permanent damages and other lasting effects there will be, they have already taken years from my life. I estimate my productive age will end around 60. With the 44.5 months they have taken as of 15 Jan 2026, they have taken 16.5% of my remaining life. Let’s be frank, I am pretty worthless now, but when this ends, I won’t be able to warp around the lost years. What they have taken away from my life is not my worthless now, but my possible future, if I have one. Moreover, as humans, we begin to decline in certain aspects after adolescence, and this decline continues in more aspects as we age further. What I could have done in these robbed years, I will have to spend longer to cover it when I am out of this persecution. Again, it is a question of whether this will come to an end someday.

The chance I can live normally with human dignity here is next to zero. The reason is the same as the example I suggested in https://github.com/AI-Migrant/doomsay/blob/main/en/Surveillance_and_Cultural_Revolution.md. I am by no means an expert, but what I wrote about the Cultural Revolution, ironically, has largely applied to my own situation in the past years.

If that is not enough, I recently came across this post on X in which some people expressed their observations on the matter: https://x.com/amandaknox/status/2015850758093320373.

They were talking about authorities, so you might say that the situation may not be as bad from the common people’s side, which should matter more to daily life. Let’s think about the reason the authorities are unapologetic. The root cause might be about appearance and status, but what enables their unapologetic behaviours is power—the absence of consequences, even if they double down instead.

As for the common people in my situation, I have already been made a lower being in society. They are encouraged and instructed to mistreat me. Where would the consequence come from? Law is also just a tool that I can come into contact with when they use it, or twist it, to restrict or punish me. Nobody is speaking up. The common people are in the same position as the authorities—a position of impunity.
