Absurd things happened during the supposed waiting period of the asylum process.

Shortly after entering the Foreigners Registration Centre in Lithuania, I overheard the mention of “6 A’s” and “number 1” for some unknown reason. I did show the Migration Department of Lithuania the result of my latest studies, hoping to let them know I was working hard and would be able to contribute, but I didn’t mention it to anyone else. Moreover, the result didn’t specify a rank, nor did I.

And why was it even their business? I don’t think there were good reasons. A reason I can think of is similar to the reason why they have been damaging my health. A crazy and pathetic one.

When I was studying in my homeland, there were some other “students”, whether or not they were students, I feel sure that they were with the persecutors now, from whom I overheard, “No way we lose to him in every aspect”. It’s funny that it didn’t appear natural to them, consider that they spent their time to help the persecutors when I spent my time to improve myself.

I should clarify that the result mentioned was actually not as impressive as it might sound. The institute I studied at was the Vocational Training Council (VTC) in Hong Kong. The exam or test was not as serious as the HKALE (A-Level, for matriculation) or even the HKDSE (for secondary five).

There was a time someone approached me suggesting that we should be closer as our nations were close to each other, and then mentioned his admiration for the patriotism and nationalism of the Chinese people. It was a time when it was already clear that every person who talked to me there was with the persecutors, but I talked to him nonetheless. By Chinese people, he most likely meant the Communist Chinese. I told him that they only take, won’t give. I told him an example of when I was studying in my homeland. I took the initiative to start a study group. I eventually stopped talking in the group because they wouldn’t say anything, even when they knew the answers to the questions raised. He changed the topic, if I remember correctly; by the end of the conversation, his friendliness had already gone.
