How mofollistic is the mentality of the persecutors, regardless of origin.

Many of the following are not serious crimes. I write about them to illustrate the mentality and behaviours of the persecutors. But you should always keep in mind not to get distracted and forget about their greater crimes.

Shortly after entering the Foreigners Registration Centre in Lithuania, I overheard the mention of “6 A’s” and “number 1” for some unknown reason. I did show the Migration Department of Lithuania the results of my latest studies, hoping to let them know I was working hard and would be able to contribute, but I didn’t mention it to anyone else. Moreover, the result didn’t specify a rank, nor did I.

And why was it even their business? I don’t think there were good reasons. A reason I can think of is similar to the reason why they have been damaging my health. A crazy and pathetic one.

When I was studying in my homeland, there were some other “students”, whether or not they were students, I feel sure that they were with the persecutors now, from whom I overheard, “No way we lose to him in every aspect”. It’s funny that it didn’t appear natural to them, considering that they spent their time helping the persecutors, whereas I spent my time improving myself.

I should clarify that the result mentioned was actually not as impressive as it might sound. The institute I studied at was the Vocational Training Council (VTC) in Hong Kong. The exam or test was not as serious as the HKALE (A-Level, for matriculation) or even the HKDSE (for secondary five).

And then, when I decided to quit the programme, a staff member contacted me. During the conversation, I mentioned the situation of the study group. Her response was something like “Oh, it’s because they don’t play with you.” Does this sound familiar if you have read my entries? It’s the “Baby, hehehe.” mentality and narrative. The persecutors seem to feel superior and are able to use that mentality to justify anything. I probably failed to respond because I was rendered speechless. 

She also asked if I read Naruto. She seemed disappointed when I answered no. I said that she could talk about it nonetheless. If I remember correctly, she said that there was a character who put everyone into a dream of an ideal world. Like Greta Thunberg, if one wants everyone listen to him or her, one has to be an emperor to do something like that character. I am not sure where that came from, but the mention of Thunberg was probably because I did something about environmental protection in a project. Again, this resonates with the persecutor group’s narrative during the supposed asylum process. Some of the names they called me include: king, boss and big boss. And for what reason? Because I don’t respond favourably to their harassment, insult, literal harm, etc.? Many of their name-calling, including “refugee”, suggests they think that I should have taken their animosity as normal, when they have a problem with even me ignoring their harassment.

There was a time someone approached me suggesting that we should be closer as our nations were close to each other, and then mentioned his admiration for the patriotism and nationalism of the Chinese people. It was a time when it was already clear that every person who talked to me there was with the persecutors, but I talked to him nonetheless. By Chinese people, he most likely meant the Communist Chinese. I told him that they only take, won’t give. I told him an example of when I was studying in my homeland. I took the initiative to start a study group. I eventually stopped talking in the group because they wouldn’t say anything, even when they knew the answers to the questions raised. He changed the topic, if I remember correctly; by the end of the conversation, his friendliness had already gone.
