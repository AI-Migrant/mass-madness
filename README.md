This is a new repo for the mass madness and crimes I have been suffering for years. Intensified since I applied for asylum in Lithuania and later in the United Kingdom.

It involved multiple governments, multinational corporations, NGOs, and pretty much any organisation or group of humans, even a large portion of the public.

The original entries can be found in the repo https://github.com/AI-Migrant/asylum_diary. Or from the original account I used to write them [locharp](https://github.com/locharp)

I do not know how humanity fell so low, or how I grew up so deceived that I can't believe what is happening.
