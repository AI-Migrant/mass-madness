# SOS
Please know that this is a serious call for help. You might be reading this on an unlikely channel, but this is not a prank.

The governments of the host countries are helping the persecutors:
1. I am under extreme surveillance constantly.
1. They have damaged my health.
2. They have been drugging and molesting me.
3. They have been intercepting my mail and digital activities.
4. My access to many things, including my own data, legal assistant, public services and even private services such retails is restricted.
5. They arranged assaults followed by an arbitrary arrest, and destroyed my phone to destroy the evidence.
6. Even before that, they arbitrarily arrested me and searched all my belongings, including those in the supposed asylum accommodation.
7. And then they stole all my belongings, including my other devices.
I essentially have been falsely imprisoned since Apr 2022. While I may appear to walk freely on the street, what I can do is very limited.
Don't fall for their narratives, such as it being normal surveillance and waiting of asylum process, they have been going out of their way to harm me.

The help I need is threefold:
1. Expose their crimes
2. Get my belongings back
3. Rid me of their surveillance and influence

Perhaps you could try to ask your government, such as the migration department, especially if you are from another EU country, to look into what happened to the asylum application of a person from Hong Kong in Lithuania around the end of Apr 2022, and in the UK in Feb 2024.

But most organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, with which I have come into contact, sided with them without question.

I am not sure where you can find people who can help me. It's unlikely that Lithuania and the UK are the only two.

I used other accounts before, but I can’t use them anymore because my belongings have been stolen. I’m accessing the internet using library computers, but they’re also monitored. I’m not sure if I am reaching anyone aside from the persecutors, nor am I sure it’ll reach me if you contact me.

If you want to confirm, I currently (2 Feb 2026) spend most of my time at the Pancras Square Library during the day and sleep on the street around the area. I am usually in a red jacket and carrying bags with signs. However, please don’t consider that I am fine just because I can still use the library to a certain degree. After they have stolen my belongings, what I can do is further limited.

This is a new repo for the mass madness and crimes I have been suffering for years, intensified since I applied for asylum in Lithuania and later in the United Kingdom.

The persecution I have been facing involves multiple governments, multinational corporations, NGOs, and pretty much any organisation or group, even a large portion of the public.

The original entries can be found in the repo github.com/AI-Migrant/asylum_diary, or from the account I originally used to write them: http://github.com/locharp

I do not know how humanity has fallen so low, or how I grew up so deceived that I can’t believe what is happening.

To put the whole persecution under one roof, the best summary is perhaps this:

## An experiment on making humans accept being treated as animals—and be grateful for it—while respecting the persecutors.

What was originally committed by one notorious regime is now joined by many.

**Partial account of the ongoing persecution**

1. I have received barely any information in the past year, and even less was genuine.
2. I have been put under extreme surveillance, constant harassment, and worse, efforts of which, if put to good use, could have prevented serious crimes or boosted productivity in other sectors.
3. My devices and networks are not only monitored but also controlled. My communication can be intercepted. The same goes for physical mail.
4. I am treated discriminatorily, not because of race, but because I have been intentionally made a lower being. One to be manipulated, controlled, and treated arbitrarily with no consequence.
5. I have been drugged for various effects on their whims, or for reasons that are probably criminal.
6. I have been subjected to effects by other means, probably involving some kind of devices.
7. They molested me indirectly using things described in the two points above.
8. They have damaged my health several times on their whims or deliberate malice. I had always been weak when I was young. I spent more than 2 decades improving my health to reach a decent level. One aspect I managed to improve to better than average was my stamina. But it’s gone because they repeatedly damaged my respiratory system.
9. There were even assaults, after which, instead of the perpetrators, I was arrested. My belongings were seized and searched. All done on nonsensical grounds.
10. I couldn’t do anything effectively. My access to anything, including public transport, is limited.
11. They have to insert themselves into every aspect of my life, and not for good reason. I can’t even buy something safely. An example is that they gave me a faulty bicycle when I wanted to buy one for commuting. Even claimed that the abnormal sound was caused because I “stressed it”. Imagine what could have happened if I had taken the word for it and commuted on that bicycle? I hesitated for a long time before buying one because I knew bad things would happen.
12. It only gets worse. Recently, they even stole my belongings. I thought that no way anyone, except real criminals, could be so shameless; they probably would return them to me, although there is no telling what kind of sick purpose they took my belongings for. But no. It’s been 4 months now (since 9 Sep 2025), and they still refuse to give me back my belongings. When I contact them, they only give me meaningless replies like those they have been using on everything throughout the years of persecution.
13. They are deliberately arranging to keep me living on the street. For humiliation? That’s for sure. The question is what other sinister reasons there are.
