This is a new repo for the mass madness and crimes I have been suffering for years, intensified since I applied for asylum in Lithuania and later in the United Kingdom.

It involves multiple governments, multinational corporations, NGOs, and pretty much any organisation or group of humans, even a large portion of the public.

The original entries can be found in the repo https://github.com/AI-Migrant/asylum_diary, or from the account I originally used to write them [locharp](https://github.com/locharp)

I do not know how humanity has fallen so low, or how I grew up so deceived that I can't believe what is happening.

To put the whole persecution under one roof, the best summary is perhaps this:

# An experiment on making humans accept being treated as animals—and be grateful for it—while respecting the persecutors.

**Partial account of the on-going persecution**

1. I have received barely any information in the past year, and even less was genuine.
2. I have been put under extreme surveillance, constant harassment, and worse, efforts of which, if put to good use, could have prevented serious crimes or boosted productivity in other sectors.
3. My devices and networks are not only monitored but also controlled. My communication can be intercepted. The same goes for physical mail.
4. I am treated discriminatorily, not because of race, but because I have been intentionally made a lower being. One to be manipulated, controlled, and treated arbitrarily with no consequence.
5. I have been drugged for various effects on their whims, or for reasons that are probably criminal.
6. I have been subjected to effects by other means, probably involving some kind of devices.
7. They molested me indirectly using things described in the two points above.
8. They have damaged my health several times on their whims, or deliberate malice. I had always been weak when I was young. I spent more than 2 decades improving my health to get to a decent level. One aspect I managed to improve to better than average was my stamina. But it’s gone because they repeatedly damaged my respiratory system.
9. There were even assaults, after which, instead of the perpetrators, I was arrested. My belongings were seized and searched. All done on nonsensical grounds.
10. I couldn't do anything effectively. My access to anything, including public transport, is limited.
11. They have to insert themselves into every aspect of my life, and not for good reason. I can't even buy something safely. An example is that they gave me a faulty bicycle when I wanted to buy one for commuting. Even claimed that the abnormal sound was caused because I "stressed it". Imagine what could have happened if I had taken the word for it and commuted on that bicycle? I hesitated for a long time before buying one because I knew bad things would happen.
12. It only gets worse. Recently, they even stole my belongings. I thought that no way anyone, except real criminals, could be so shameless; they probably would return them to me, although there is no telling what kind of sick purpose they took my belongings for. But no. It's been 3 months now (since 9 Sep 2025), they still refuse to give me back my belongings. When I contact them, they only give me meaningless replies like those they have been using on everything throughout the years of persecution.
13. They are deliberately arranging to have me continue living on the street. For humiliation? That’s for sure. The question is what other sinister reasons there are.
